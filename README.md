# AI-ML-module

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines,
 especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural
 language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. AI technology is important because it 
enables human capabilities – understanding, reasoning, planning, communication and perception – 
to be undertaken by software increasingly effectively, efficiently and at low cost. ...
 Use cases are proliferating as AI's potential is understood.

# How does AI work?
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors 
have been scrambling to promote how their products
 and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is 
simply one component of AI, such as machine learning.
 AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and 
software for writing and training machine learning algorithms.
 No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, 
including Python, R and Java, are popular.

In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled
 training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns,
 and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. 
In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn 
to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition 
tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.

AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills:
 learning,
 reasoning and
 self-correction.

Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating 
rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms,
 provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.

# 3 Types of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)


# Ethics of artificial intelligence:


The ethics of artificial intelligence is the branch of the ethics of technology specific to
 artificially intelligent systems.[1] It is sometimes divided into a concern with the moral 
behavior of humans as they design, make, use and treat artificially intelligent systems, 
and a concern with the behavior of machines, in machine ethics. It also includes the issue 
of a possible singularity due to superintelligent AI.

# Robot ethics:

The term "robot ethics" (sometimes "roboethics") refers to the morality of how humans design,
 construct, use and treat robots.[2] Robot ethics intersect with the ethics of AI. Robots are
 physical machines whereas AI can be only software.[3] Not all robots functions through 
AI systems and not all AI systems are robots. Robot ethics considers how machines may be used
 to harm or benefit humans, their impact on individual autonomy, and their effects on social justice.


# Machine ethics:

Machine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs),
 robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral.
To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, 
like the standard characterizations of agency, rational agency, moral agency, and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs
